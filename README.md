# ServiceLocatorPattern_Example
A playground with a simple implementaion of Service Locator Pattern for eaiser Dependncy Injection and simple unit testing

The service locator pattern is designed to encapsulate the processes invovled in obtaining a service with a strong layer of abstraction.

the example consists of two mock processes (fetching from Database & saving into CoreData). each process abstracted away in a single responsability class.

The DataManager class is responsible for the data and handling it.
